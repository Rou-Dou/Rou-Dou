<h2>Matthew Mahoney: Data Analyst</h2>
<br>
<p>Hello, my name is Matthew Mahoney and I am currently trying to break into the tech world in data. I have spent the last 6 years at Amazon working with Alexa, and in that time I have begun exploring data analysis and programming using R, Python and SQL.</p>
<br>
<p>As I find time to work on projects in my free time I do my best to keep them updated here. Currently I'm working on a standard python programming projects, as well as working on sound design and impelmentation in a game in unreal engine. Next I intend to start some new data analysis projects to further explore the capabilities of the pandas library in python.</p>

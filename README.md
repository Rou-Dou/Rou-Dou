<p>Hello, my name is Matthew Mahoney and I am currently trying to break into the tech world in data. I have spent the last 6 years at Amazon working with Alexa, and in that time I have begun exploring data analysis and programming using R, Python and SQL.</p>
<br>
<h3>Current projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>🚧 Currently working on some simple python programming projects to solidfy new concepts, as well as working on sound design and impelmentation for a game in unreal engine.</li>
  <li>🌱 Currently learning OOP in C/C++ and refreshing myself on T-SQL.
  <li>⏭ Next I plan to start some new data analysis projects to further explore the capabilities of the pandas library in python.</li>
</ul>
